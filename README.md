9th ROBOCODE - 2021
In times of social isolation, nothing better than having the opportunity to use platforms that help in the teaching-learning process, helping to assimilate the technical concepts of programming, in a playful way. In addition to the technical part, when participating in this activity, other skills and abilities are implicitly being worked on, such as teamwork, technological tools for remote communication, dexterity, behavior, responsibility, integration, communication, organization and planning.


To carry out this tournament, the RobocodeÂ® Software is used, which is a programming game, where the objective is to develop/adapt a war tank to battle against other tanks in a virtual arena using the Java programming language. Used as a tool in the teaching-learning process in programming and artificial intelligence (AI).
